# WeatherReportAssignment

> Task Description:
  - [x] 	•	Read the file 'temperatures.csv' which has been downloaded from the German weather service and contains timestamps and temperatures.
  - [x] 	•	Convert the time steps of the temperature data to 15-minutes-intervals, using interpolation.
  - [x] 	•	Find the hottest and coldest temperature values for every year and their time of occurrence. Store this information in a human-readable file (csv or other text file or graphic).
  - [x] 	•	Plot the temperatures for the hottest days of each provided year onto the same axis, over time of day.
  - [x] 	•	Do the same for the coldest days of each year.
  - [x]   •	Perform one more analysis that you find interesting on the same data.

> General hints:
  - [x] •	Use Python 3 for your solution.
  - [x] •	Provide comments in English where appropriate.
  - [x] •	Feel free to ask questions if unsure.
  - [x] - [x] •	If you use extensive resources or copy large chunks of code, please provide the source in the comments.
  - [x] •	Split your code into several files, use and reuse functions where appropriate.
  - [x] •	Bonus: Use Git, and hand in a Git repository (local copy is sufficient).


	
> Stepwise execution of the algorithm
- [x] •You can run this file from command line in the following way.
     - [x] •python WeatherApplication.py --path "dataPath" --input "inputFile_Path" --dest "destinationFile_path"
            Example:python WeatherApplication.py --path "./data" --input "temperatures.csv" --dest "temperatures_stats.csv"
- [x] Ouput will be saved dataPath/output folder.
